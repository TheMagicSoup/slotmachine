# slotmachine
The GitHub repo for my final school project!
This is a slot machine, with different features that hopefully combine to form a project complex enough to net decent marks.\
![SPIN](https://github.com/TheMagicSoup/slotmachine/blob/main/src/slotto/spin.png?raw=true)\
**This slot machine includes:**
* Slots that give randomised results
    *Graphics that update to reflect those results
* A bet-based system that returns based on what's inputted
* A nudge button
* More to come like:
	*Hold button
	*Graphics overhaul
		*Animated slots
		*Cleaner GUI
	*Pay table?
